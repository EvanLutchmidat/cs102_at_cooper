# Intro to working with types

## Working with ASCII characters and wrapping
Review ```run.ascii.sh``` Bash script to see how to build (compile then link) the ascii.exe program and then run it and copy output to a log file that keeps appending.
```bash
$ ./run.ascii.sh
```
Or run
```bash
$ make -f Makefile.ascii clean run
```

Check ```ascii.c``` for the example of how to wrap with ```char`` data type.

On macos, replace ```make``` with ```gmake```

## Working with C types and learning their processor-based limits
Review ```run.limits.sh``` Bash script to see how to build (compile then link) the limits.exe program and then run it and copy output to a log file that keeps appending.
```bash
$ ./run.limits.sh
```
Or run
```bash
$ make -f Makefile.limits clean run
```
On macos, replace ```make``` with ```gmake```
